Dependencies
                  Python:
                  Python 3.8 or later is recommended.

                  PyTorch:
                  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

                  Ultralytics YOLOv8:
                  pip install ultralytics

                  OpenCV:
                  pip install opencv-python-headless

                  NumPy,Pillow,Matplotlib,PyYAML

                                                                                   FasterRCNN Object Detection Training and Testing

        

Dependencies
                If you have already installed the above libraries. Install the one below

                Install Detectron2 with the following commands:                  
                python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'


The Dataset was not able to upload in github because of its huge size. We used COCO Dataset, for pose estimation, and chairs detection.
The model files of FasterRCNN Is also not uploaded. I will provide the link of the drive where i upload it.
